## Sequence Details
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

These plots show the aftershock sequence. They were last updated at 2020/04/11 06:47:57 UTC, 7.2 days after the mainshock.

1874 M&ge;0 earthquakes within 10 km of the mainshock's epicenter.


|  | First Hour | First Day | First Week | To Date |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **M 0** | 104 | 590 | 1866 | 1874 |
| **M 1** | 88 | 255 | 573 | 573 |

| **M 3** | 3 | 6 | 12 | 12 |
### Magnitude vs Time Plot
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

This plot shows the magnitude vs time evolution of the sequence. The mainshock is ploted as brown a brown circle, foreshocks are plotted as green circles, and aftershocks are plotted as cyan circles.

### Cumulative Number Plot
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

This plot shows the cumulative number of M&ge;0 aftershocks as a function of time since the mainshock.

### Magnitude-Number Distributions
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

These plot shows the magnitude-number distrubtion of the aftershock sequence thus far. The left plot gives an incremental distribution (the count in each magnitude bin), and the right plot a cumulative distribution (the count in or above each magnitude bin). The y-axis is logarithmic.
