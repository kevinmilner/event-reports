## Sequence Details
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

These plots show the aftershock sequence. They were last updated at 2020/04/14 00:33:02 UTC, 282.88 days after the mainshock.

5409 M&ge;2 earthquakes within 47.75 km of the mainshock's epicenter.


|  | First Hour | First Day | First Week | First Month | To Date |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **M 2** | 239 | 1851 | 3281 | 4307 | 5409 |
| **M 3** | 226 | 608 | 770 | 881 | 977 |
| **M 4** | 45 | 67 | 75 | 81 | 84 |
| **M 5** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
### Aftershock Locations
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

Map view of the aftershock sequence, plotted as cyan circles. The mainshock  and foreshocks are plotted below in brown and green circles respectively, but may be obscured by aftershocks. Nearby UCERF3 fault traces are plotted in gray lines, and the region used to fetch aftershock data in a dashed dark gray line.

### Magnitude vs Time Plot
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

This plot shows the magnitude vs time evolution of the sequence. The mainshock is ploted as brown a brown circle, foreshocks are plotted as green circles, and aftershocks are plotted as cyan circles.

### Cumulative Number Plot
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

This plot shows the cumulative number of M&ge;2 aftershocks as a function of time since the mainshock.

### Magnitude-Number Distributions
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

These plot shows the magnitude-number distrubtion of the aftershock sequence thus far. The left plot gives an incremental distribution (the count in each magnitude bin), and the right plot a cumulative distribution (the count in or above each magnitude bin). The y-axis is logarithmic.

## Significant Foreshocks
*[(top)](#table-of-contents)*

Foreshock(s) with M&ge;6 or with M&ge;M<sub>Mainshock</sub>-1.
